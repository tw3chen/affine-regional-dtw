NOTE: Result reproduction relies heavily on the use of MATLAB, and the machine that went through the below steps is a Windows 8 machine.

INSTALLATION
 1. Extract ARDTWPackage.rar to a folder (say ARDTWPackage).
 2. Download Subaxis.m and export_fig.m from MATHWORKS, and add the two files to MATLAB path. These 2 files are used to plot and export figures.
 3. Go to ARDTWPackage/Code and type the following commands in MATLAB:
    mex RDTW.cpp;
    mex ComputeGARDTWParam.cpp;
    mex LARDTW.cpp;
 4. Add ARDTWPackage/Code to MATLAB path.

    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 1
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 2. Figure 2
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 2
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 3. Figure 3
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 3
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 4. Figure 4
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 4
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 5. Figure 5
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 5
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 6. Figure 6
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 6
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 7. Figure 7
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Obtain Global Alignment Results
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
    Wait until completion of code
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 7
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 8. Figure 8
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Obtain Component-Based Alignment Results
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
    Wait until completion of code
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 8
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
 9. Obtain results needed to reproduce Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 12, Table 2
    Download the UCR time series database and extract the dataset folders to ARDTWPackage/Dataset/Classification
    Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Obtain Difference Measure Results
    Run Main.m in MATLAB
    Wait until completion of code (this might take several days or even weeks, and it is recommended to run it for 1 dataset at a time)
10. Figure 9, Figure 10, Table 2
    Step 9 needs to be completed first
	Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 9
	Run Main.m in MATLAB (outputs Table.txt containing Table 1 in LATEX format and the figures in jpg images)
11. Figure 11
	Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Obtain Global Alignment Results - Vary Warpings
	Run Main.m in MATLAB
	Wait until completion of code
	Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 10
	Run Main.m in MATLAB
11. Figure 12
	Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 12
	Run Main.m in MATLAB
12. Figure 13
	Go to ARDTWPackage/Code/Figure 13
	Run RecordTime.m in MATLAB
	Wait until completion of code
	Run Main.m in MATLAB
